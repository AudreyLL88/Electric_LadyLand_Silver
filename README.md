### Design Choices ###
---
When crafting this website, I looked at **other jewelry schools** such as [**L'Ecole Van Cleef Arpels**](https://www.lecolevancleefarpels.com/hk/en) and [**The Silversmith Guild of Canterbury**](https://www.silversmithsguild.org.nz/Classes) to consult the **relevant sections** to be in use, then added my **personal touches**. I also applied what I had learnt during the **Udemy FullStack Developer Bootcamp**  as well as **the Whisky drop challenge with Code Institute**. 

**Fonts**

I was concerned about the amount of text in the website, so I checked what were **popular Google Fonts pairing in 2020**, and after a bit of fidgeting I chose to pick [**Arvo**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo) for the headings and [**Cabin**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) for other elements.

**Icons**

**All icons** used on the website are provided by [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) and are there mostly (at the exception of the About section) to highlight **the buttons functonality and the FAQs text**.

**Colors**

**Electric Ladyland Silver** already had a **very strong visual identity** inspired by **South Western America and Native American culture**. Most of the colors used on the website are from [**The American Southwest Color Palette**](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/45255).

* For the index page
* H1: #fffff white with a #140d07 shadow
* Colored section: #140d07 background #f5f8e4 text
* Light Section:  #f5f8e4 background  #140d07 text
* Images and pricing cards shadow: #719f9f
* Buttons and icons : #719f9f with #ed8b22 hover effect

* For all other pages:
* Background: #f5f8e4
* Text: #140d07
* Buttons and icons: #719f9f with #ed8b22 hover effects

## Wireframing ##
---
For **wireframing** I used [**JustInMind**](https://www.justinmind.com/) rather than **Balsamiq** as I wanted to include **pictures and text** to show it to **the company owner**. Making this **wireframe** really helped me understand **the complexity behind the Google calendar and the registration form** and how to make it coherent.
It also allowed **my mentor** to point out a few **UX mistakes** that I changed after my meeting with him.

View my wireframes [here](assets/wireframe/ElectricLadyLand-wireframe.pdf).
What didn't make the cut and why:
Screens

## Testing ##
---

* I tested the responsiveness of the website by using the [**Google Chrome DeveloperTool**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and the website [**Am I Responsive**](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).
* I tested my CSS file and my HTML files using [**CSS Validator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [**HTML Validator**](https://validator.w3.org/).
* My CSS file displayed no error but I had to fix a few problems concerning **the google font syntax**, **the id of my navigation bar**, **the modal button syntax** as well as t**he call to action buttons syntax**. More about the process below.


**Responsiveness**

* **Implementation** 

I used the **Bootstrap grid system** as well as some **custom CSS media queries** to ensure that the website didn't break on all screen sizes.

**Design**

* **Implementation** 

The design of the site was inspired by **South western culture** but kept **minimal** for **maximal information content and accessibility**.

**Contact form**

* **Implementation** 

I used the **contact form** that was introduced to us during [**the mini project challenge**](https://github.com/AudreyLL88/mini-project-cv) because I liked how it sit **in the middle of the page and is very straightforward**. I wanted to add **an "add images" button** but realized that **I needed to know some JS**. I customized it a bit by **adding margins and a modal button**. As of now, the contact form button **doesn't work (lack of PHP)** but it will be **implemented in the future**. 
All input elements work and **are responsive**.

**Google Calendar**

* **Implementation**

Embedding a **Google Calendar** is pretty straightforward and customable within the Google site and I initially did some **inline styling in the iframe** so the calendar would take **100% width/height of the column on all device**... and **HTML Validator didn't like that** so I moved it to **CSS**, which all validators liked. Good Job me.

**Registration Form**

* **Implementation**

**Bootstrap** has extensive **documentation** about forms so I extracted the code from **the Bootstrap documentation** and build my own **fitting input areas** and **modal buttons**. I fitted the form on **lg and md screen next to the calendar** and **for sm screens I fitted it under the calendar** and added some **padding** between the sections in a **corresponding media query**.

**Image Gallery**

* **Implementation**

**My mentor** suggested after seeing my **wireframe** duriing our preliminary meeting that I should use the **Fancybox library**. After researching it, I **resized my images with Gimp** to create the thumbnails and used this[**Bootstrap gallery template**](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/thumbnail-gallery/)for the **responsivness** and added the **Fancybox "data-fancybox"** and **alt text**.**

## Bugs ##

---

I still have **nightmares** about **bootstrap cards**. **The horror, oh the horror**.

But that's not all, so here we go:

**During development**

* **Cards responsivness:**
* Initial card image top didn't fit on lg screen so I went for a bigger image.
* Then the card was taking too much width on lg and sm screen (strangely it was ok on md screen) no matter what grid system I would use. So I started again from zero.
* Extracted the code from the Bootstrap library and added the .card-img-top class to my image and it worked.
* I almost cried of happiness.
* Then I added a list in the card-body and everything broke down in lenght because it was too much text.
* So I decided to go for a small paragraph of text and it looked a 100% times better. To me the cards are still a bit long and this is something I will work more on in the future.

**Navigation Bar**
* Nav section didnt have a heading, got flagged by html validator.
* Changed section tag for div, and got the same results, so I completely removed the div and let the navbar breath by itself, which seems fine.

**Call to action buttons**
* Originally started with a "button" then realized that i needed a "a" instead but left the type="submit" in it.
* HTML validator strongly disagreed so I removed it.
