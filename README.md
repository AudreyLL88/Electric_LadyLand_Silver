<a name="design-choices"></a>

### Design Choices ###
---
When crafting this website, I looked at **other jewelry schools** such as [**L'Ecole Van Cleef Arpels**](https://www.lecolevancleefarpels.com/hk/en) and [**The Silversmith Guild of Canterbury**](https://www.silversmithsguild.org.nz/Classes) to consult the **relevant sections** to be in use, then added my **personal touches**. I also applied what I had learnt during the **Udemy FullStack Developer Bootcamp**  as well as **the Whisky drop challenge with Code Institute**. 

<a name="fonts"></a>

### Fonts ###

I was concerned about the amount of text in the website, so I checked what were **popular Google Fonts pairing in 2020**, and after a bit of fidgeting I chose to pick [**Arvo**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo) for the headings and [**Cabin**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) for other elements.

<a name="icons"></a>

### Icons ###

**All icons** used on the website are provided by [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) and are there mostly (at the exception of the About section) to highlight **the buttons functonality and the FAQs text**.

<a name="colors"></a>

### Colors ###

**Electric Ladyland Silver** already had a **very strong visual identity** inspired by **South Western America and Native American culture**. Most of the colors used on the website are from [**The American Southwest Color Palette**](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/45255).

* For the index page
* H1: #fffff white with a #140d07 shadow
* Colored section: #140d07 background #f5f8e4 text
* Light Section:  #f5f8e4 background  #140d07 text
* Images and pricing cards shadow: #719f9f
* Buttons: #719f9f with #ed8b22 hover effect

* For all other pages:
* Background: #f5f8e4
* Text: #140d07
* Buttons: #719f9f with #ed8b22 hover effects

## Wireframing ##
---
For **wireframing** I used [**JustInMind**](https://www.justinmind.com/) rather than **Balsamiq** as I wanted to include **pictures and text** to show it to **the company owner**. Making this **wireframe** really helped me understand **the complexity behind the Google calendar and the registration form** and how to make it coherent.
It also allowed **my mentor** to point out a few **UX mistakes** that I changed after my meeting with him.

View my wireframes [here](assets/wireframe/ElectricLadyLand-wireframe.pdf).

You'll notice that my wireframe is different than the website. After my preliminary meeting with my mentor, I decided under his supervision to let go of the following things for a better UX:
* The **Header title** became white with a lighter shadow and an opacity layer on the hero image rather than a semi-transparent turquoise jumbotron.
* The **Book a class button** on the Hero image went down to the **"Gallery"** button in the **About Section**.
* The **navigation bar** changes depending on which pagethe user is on.
* The **about** section link in the **navigation bar** was **removed**.
* The **review section** is now placed **after** the **pricing card section**.
* The **Any Question** section became a **Call to Action** section with a **contact button** leading to a **contact page with a form**.
* The **contact details** are moved in the **footer**.

## Testing ##
---

* I tested the responsiveness of the website by using the [**Google Chrome DeveloperTool**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and the website [**Am I Responsive**](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/). 
* I also tested my website on **different browsers and real devices** : **Iphone 6s, Iphone X, Ipad Pro 12", Macbook air and Samsung Galaxy S20.**
* I used [**CodePly**](https://www.codeply.com/) to pre-test parts of my HTML and CSS code before adding it to my workspace which was great but sometimes resulted in forgetting to copy/paste some css or classes.
* I tested my CSS file and my HTML files using [**CSS Validator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [**HTML Validator**](https://validator.w3.org/), which highlighted my mistakes in copy/pasting from CodePly.
* My CSS file displayed no error but I had to fix a few problems concerning **the google font syntax**, **the id of my navigation bar**, as well as **the call to action buttons syntax**. More about the process below.

All pages passed the HTML and CSS validator final test.

**Responsiveness**

* **Implementation** 

I used the **Bootstrap grid system** as well as some **custom CSS media queries** to ensure that the website didn't break on all screen sizes.

**Design**

* **Implementation** 

The design of the site was inspired by **South western culture** but kept **minimal** for **maximal information content and accessibility**.

**Contact form**

* **Implementation** 

I used the **contact form** that was introduced to us during [**the mini project challenge**](https://github.com/AudreyLL88/mini-project-cv) because I liked how it sit **in the middle of the page and is very straightforward**. I wanted to add **an "add images" button** but realized that **I needed to know some JS**. I customized it a bit by **adding margins, a checkbox and a modal button**. As skills grows, **JavaScript** will be introduced to **ensure** that the form must be **validated before modal appears**. For now the **contact form** doesn't work as it is not using a **PHP**. 
All input elements work and **are responsive**.

**Google Calendar**

* **Implementation**

Embedding a **Google Calendar** is pretty straightforward and customable within the Google site and I initially did some **inline styling in the iframe** so the calendar would take **100% width/height of the column on all device**... and **HTML Validator didn't like that** so I moved it to **CSS**, which all validators liked. Good Job me.

**Registration Forms**

* **Implementation**

**Bootstrap** has extensive **documentation** about forms so I extracted the code from **the Bootstrap documentation** and build my own **fitting input areas** and **modal buttons**. I fitted the form on **lg and md screen next to the calendar** and **for sm screens I fitted it under the calendar** and added some **padding** between the sections in a **corresponding media query**. As skills grows, **JavaScript** will be introduced to **ensure** that the form must be **validated before modal appears**. For now the **registration form** doesn't work as it is not using a **PHP**,

**Image Gallery**

* **Implementation**

**My mentor** suggested after seeing my **wireframe** during our preliminary meeting that I should use the **Fancybox library**. After researching it, I **resized my images with Gimp** to create the thumbnails and used this[**Bootstrap gallery template**](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/thumbnail-gallery/)for the **responsivness** and added the **Fancybox "data-fancybox"** and **alt text**.**

**Modal buttons**

* **Implementation**

* I used the **Bootstrap documentation** to implement a **modal on button click** in the **contact form** and the **registration form** and **customized it** with according text and button styling.

## Bugs ##
---

I still have **nightmares** about **bootstrap cards**. **The horror, oh the horror**. It doesn't show on my commits because I wanted to commit only when I was satisfied with it.

But that's not all, so here we go:

**During development**

* **Cards responsivness:**
* Initial card image top didn't fit on lg screen so I went for a bigger image.
* Then the card was taking too much width on lg and sm screen (strangely it was ok on md screen) no matter what grid system I would use. So I started again from zero.
* Extracted the code from the Bootstrap library and added the .card-img-top class to my image and it worked.
* I almost cried of happiness.
* Then I added a list in the card-body and everything broke down in lenght because it was too much text.
* So I decided to go for a small paragraph of text and it looked a 100% times better. To me the cards are still a bit long and this is something I will work more on in the future.

**Navigation Bar**
* Nav section didnt have a heading, got flagged by html validator.
* Changed section tag for div, and got the same results, so I completely removed the div and let the navbar breath by itself, which seems fine.

**Call to action buttons**
* Originally started with a "button" then realized that i needed a "a" instead but left the type="submit" in it.
* HTML validator strongly disagreed so I removed it.

**Google Fonts syntax link**
* I had taken my fonts as a family pair and HTML validator didn't like that at all.
* I went on google fonts and selected the fonts and their weight manually then added that link and it worked.

**Overflow**
* After deploying my website and submitting it for peer-review on Slack another student picked on my website having a bit of overflow on mobile.
* I downloaded Unicorn Revealer (Chrome extenstion), grabbed a web designer friend and discovered it was the bootstrap row class in the hero-container of my Title section in index.html.
* I removed it and it now works beautifully.

## Deployment ##
---
Electric LadyLand Silver was developed on **GitPod**, using **GitHub** to host the repository and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
**GitHub** made the deployment extremely painless:

* Connected to Github
* Selected the repository **AudreyLL88/Electric_LadyLand_Silver**
* Clicked on **"settings"** in the navigation bar
* In the **GitHub Pages** I selected **Master Branch** and **/root** in the dropdown menu and clicked **Save**
* I waited 2 minutes.
* And voila! **The website is now live on  https://audreyll88.github.io/Electric_LadyLand_Silver/**

**Cloning ?** No problem:

* In my repository **AudreyLL88/MS1**, click on the **"Code"** green button, **copy in clipboard the HTTPS link**, open your **browser** and look through my files.
* The link : **https://github.com/AudreyLL88/Electric_LadyLand_Silver.git**
